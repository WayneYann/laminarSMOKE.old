laminarSMOKE
============
CFD solver for laminar reacting flows with detailed kinetic mechanisms based on OpenFOAM and OpenSMOKE++ Library

Compulsory libraries
--------------------
- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- RapidXML (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/)
- Boost C++ (http://www.boost.org/)
- OpenSMOKE++ (alberto.cuoci@polimi.it)

Optional libraries
------------------
- Intel MKL (https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)
- ODEPACK (http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/odepack_home.html)
- DVODE (http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/odepack_home.html)
- DASPK (http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html)
- Sundials (http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html)
- MEBDF (http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~jcash/IVP_software/readme.html)
- RADAU (http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html)

Compilation
-----------
Three different options are available to compile the code, according to the level of support for the solution of ODE systems
1. Minimalist: no external, optional libraries are required. Only the native OpenSMOKE++ ODE solver can be used.
2. Minimalist + Intel MKL: only the native OpenSMOKE++ ODE solver can be used, but linear algebra operations are managed by the Intel MKL libraries
3. Complete: all the optional libraries are linked to the code, in order to have the possibility to work with different ODE solvers

1. Instructions to compile the Minimalist version
-------------------------------------------------
1. Open the `mybashrc.minimalist` and adjust the paths to the compulsory external libraries
2. Type: `source mybashrc.minimalist`
3. Compile the steady-state solver: from the `solver/laminarSimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`
4. Compile the unsteady solver: from the `solver/laminarPimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`

2. Instructions to compile the Minimalist+MKL version
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Open the `mybashrc.minimalist.mkl` and adjust the paths to the compulsory external libraries and the paths to the Intel MKL library
2. Type: `source mybashrc.minimalist.mkl`
3. Compile the steady-state solver: from the `solver/laminarSimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`
4. Compile the unsteady solver: from the `solver/laminarPimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`

3. Instructions to compile the Complete version
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Open the `mybashrc.complete` and adjust the paths to the compulsory external libraries and the Intel MKL library. You can choose the additional external libraries you want to add to laminarSMOKE, by modifying the `EXTERNAL_ODE_SOLVERS` variable: in particular `1` means that the support is requested, while `0` means that no support is requested. Obviously, for each requested library, you need to provide the correct path.
2. Type: `source mybashrc.complete`
3. Compile the steady-state solver: from the `solver/laminarSimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`
4. Compile the unsteady solver: from the `solver/laminarPimpleSMOKE` folder type `wmake`


Run your first case
-------------------
The folder `cases/Toro-Flames/F3` contains a simple test case (laminar coflow diffusion flame fed with hydrogen).

1. Unsteady simulation: Open the `laminarPimpleSMOKE-Global` folder, build the mesh using the `blockMesh` utility, and run the case using the `laminarPimpleSMOKE` solver. Even if you are interested in steady state conditions, we strongly suggest to always start with unsteady calculations to create a reasonable first-guess solution for the application of the steady state solver. In this case, you can stop the unsteady simulation after 50 ms of physical time.

2. Steady state simuation: you can now move to the `laminarSimpleSMOKE-Global` folder. Copy the last time folder calculated by the unsteady solver (point 1 above), build the mesh using the `blockMesh` utility, and run the case using the `laminarSimpleSMOKE` solver. In order to reach the steady state conditions, 5000-6000 iterations are enough.
